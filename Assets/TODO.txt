Notes

* Overall I find the initial 'roguelike' fun exploring the dungeon, so I guess the biggest thing is the running and no ability to really fight back
* 

Not fun
* getting a goblin with 3 health and no teleport means leveling is impossible at the start.
* perma death on non slime* boss
* Health is to important, need to reduce how much you get, while adding in a defence option

Bugs

* Have a you have died screen
* on the corral and can't select the second monster.. not that selecting does anything right now. can select now that have more then 1 monster, okay it was aspect instead.
* enemies can go diaonal but players can't, skills would be okay, but movement should be fair.
* I got a level 5 and im not sure how.. maybe the player and monster on the exit at the same time.

Big Goals
* Redo the breeding system to not just add two togheter
* make the stats important
* have a town you can walk around in, interact with villagers, shop and eventually build new buildings 
* add traps to the ground
* add items to pickup and use


Done
* Fix Fonts so they are readable * was just set to a small resolution
* at 1/5 teleports and can't teleports * bad user, the gap was to far.
